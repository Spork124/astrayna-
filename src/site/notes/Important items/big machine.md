# Big machine
## Introduced as
The big machine in the [[Places/rundown lab\|rundown lab]] that [[Characters/Caelus\|Caelus]] is set on fixing. 
## Plot importance
This machine ends up being something that can transport the duo back to [[Places/The lab\|The lab]], however there's only enough power in the emergency generators to transport one person. 
## History
It was made by the [[Clans/Ortiz\|Ortiz]] clan to allow them to travel back and forth between the planets. Since they died out, the machine has become more rundown, and not as safe to use.
