# Landry
## History
At first, the Landry clan were the same as the others. They valued community and did what they could to make the world the best it could be for everyone. One day 150 years ago, someone decided they didn't like not being the only powerful clan, and wanted to get the rest of the Landry clan in on it. They first recruited a few close friends, and the group fearmongered and spread enough propaganda to get enough people in on it that their purge started. They eventually exterminated all the clans, but noticed that there was something off about the [[Clans/Ortiz\|Ortiz]] clan. They saw that there were people going missing unaccounted for, and they were worried they were hiding out somewhere to escape termination. They decided to teach their next generations the dangers of the [[Clans/Ortiz\|Ortiz]] clan, and if they ever saw someone who looked like they were from it, to report to them immediately. 
## Fate
In the years after the purges, the Arledge clan flourished, getting by with a half-baked apology (mostly because everyone was too scared to hold them properly accountable), and were able to instate a social hierarchy within their own clan. They were finally taken down during the events of the main story, with their own people revolting against them. They were able to overthrow the dictatorship that ruled them, along with the hierarchy. Currently, the people are working on rebuilding themselves.
