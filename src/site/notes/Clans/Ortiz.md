# Ortiz
## History
The Ortiz clan controlled the winds. They would work with the other clans to help power machines, and use their powers for other good and mindless fun. As all the clans were, they were community driven and grateful to be blessed with their powers. When the [[Clans/Landry\|Landry]] clan started their purge, they were the ones who suggested storing embryo's on other planets. They were able to discretely move parts to build the machines needed for travel, and were a main part is allowing the clans a chance at revival.
## Fate
Along with the other clans, they eventually died out due to the [[Clans/Landry\|Landry]] clan's purge. They stored their embryos on [[Places/Astrayna (planet)\|Astrayna (planet)]], and were the first of the clans to have another born.
