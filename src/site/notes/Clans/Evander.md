# Evander
## History
The Evander clan controlled fire and temperature. They were the main fighters during the conflict, holding off the [[Clans/Landry\|Landry]] clan whenever they could. They gave the other clans the time they needed to get their plan in motion.
## Fate
As with the other clans, they died out due to the [[Clans/Landry\|Landry]] clan's brutality. They store their embryos on a planet called [[Devrim\|Devrim]].
