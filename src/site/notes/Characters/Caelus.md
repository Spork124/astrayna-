# Caelus (he/him)
## Backstory
Caelus was born to a family with his mother and father, who were never good examples for him. His father was a control freak over his mother, and hated Caelus because he couldn’t do the same to him. His mother did nothing to stop the abuse against herself or her child, and just drank to deal with it. Up until he was 13, he spent as much time out of the house as he could, avoiding his father and mother. At that age, his father found out that Caelus was not his child, and murdered his mother due to this. Caelus came home to find what had happened, and his father threatened him that he would do the same to him. Caelus ran away from home then, bouncing between people’s houses until he found The Lab at 17, who took him in. He lived there for a few years, separated from the part that actually did research until he was 20. At that point he got transferred so he could work in tech research.
