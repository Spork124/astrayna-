# Arledge (he/they)
## Backstory
Being part of the Landry clan, high expectations were always put on him. However, due to their early autism diagnosis, he was considered a lost cause. Unfortunately, there was one person, a part of the higher ups, who saw potential in him. She thought that if she could get rid of the autism, she could create a strong fighter. For obvious reasons, that didn’t happen. They were given until they turned 18 to “meet expectations” or else they would be “placed with people where he had a better opportunity to thrive”. This place was the lab, which he resented at first. However, they grew quite fond of The Lab and the people there, seeing it as a true home and second family. Except for Caelus, the two don’t get along well. Although he enjoys his time at The Lab, he still longs to feel a place of belonging in his family. He joined the lab when he was 18.
## Character Arc and Post story
Arledge starts his character arc pre-story, but it accelerates during it. Pre story, when Arledge first arrived at [[Places/The lab\|The lab]], he still believed he was better than the average person simply because he was of the [[Clans/Landry\|Landry]] clan. After getting to know everyone in [[Places/The lab\|The lab]], he realized this wasn't true, at least not as a general rule. While he still acted prestigious, he was able to set it aside when needed and became a lot more agreeable. During the story, he is able to come to terms with his autism, and fully put aside any pride he had from being part of the [[Clans/Landry\|Landry]] clan. While he's able to realize the good things their clan has done, he recognizes that the ones in control were corrupt, and things needed to change. He became more empathetic towards the common person, and learned to recognize when he doesn't have the answer to something. At the end of the story, he ends up becoming permanently physically disabled from being in a collapsing building, including loosing an eye. Post story, he learns how to handle that, along with helping the [[Clans/Landry\|Landry]] clan rebuild themselves into a more fair society.
