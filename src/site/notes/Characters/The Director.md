# The Director (he/they/it)
## Backstory
He roamed the universe for centuries, going wherever he wanted whenever he wanted. He used to do this with his friend, Astrayna, before she one day told him she had to leave, and she never saw her again. After she left, he was drawn to a nearby planet that he hadn’t seen before. Everything about it reminded him of his old friend, and thus he named the planet Astrayna. When he got there, he witnessed the Ortiz clan coming and storing their embryo’s there and trying to make a life for themselves. He, however, interacted with them as little as possible. Once the Ortiz clan died out, he decided to look through their lab, and saw an embryo somehow teleport away. He researched the embryo’s there, and followed the one that had disappeared to the planet the main cast are from. This planet, however, had a tendency to attract powerful things, and not allow them to leave with the opportunity to come back. He chooses to stay, forming a team of people to help him research in hopes he can freely traverse the universe again.
