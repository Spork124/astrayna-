# Unnatural amalgamations
## Introduced as
The unnatural amalgamations are first introduced when Caelus and Arledge are leaving from meeting the [[Characters/civilization\|civilization]] for the first time. Arledge immediately recognizes that they aren't natural, and learns of them being unstable. The two decide to try to avoid them as much as possible in the future
## Plot importance
The unnatural amalgamations are what the [[Characters/civilization\|civilization]] sends out to ensure no one can get inside the [[Places/rundown lab\|rundown lab]]. They're an amalgamation of the most aggressive parts of the natural animals, along with whatever animals are the largest. They were made without concern for their quality of life, or how easy it would be to kill if someone tried to fight back. Their goal was to create something scary, strong, and that the average person couldn't defeat, along with being able to reproduce.
