# Backstory
Being part of the Landry clan, high expectations were always put on him. However, due to their early autism diagnosis, he was considered a lost cause. Unfortunately, there was one person, a part of the higher ups, who saw potential in him. She thought that if she could get rid of the autism, she could create a strong fighter. For obvious reasons, that didn’t happen. They were given until they turned 18 to “meet expectations” or else they would be “placed with people where he had a better opportunity to thrive”. This place was the lab, which he resented at first. However, they grew quite fond of The Lab and the people there, seeing it as a true home and second family. Except for Caelus, the two don’t get along well. Although he enjoys his time at The Lab, he still longs to feel a place of belonging in his family. He joined the lab when he was 18.
