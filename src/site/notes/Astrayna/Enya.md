# Backstory
She grew up in a typical middle class family, and had a childhood friend she grew up with. When she was 16, her friend went missing. This friend had been saying that something was trying to reach her for weeks now, so Enya is certain she's still out there, and just hasn't been found yet. In the coming year, she would look into everything she could as to where her friend might have gone, but to no avail. No one even believed that she could still be out there, as least not alive. However, [[Astrayna/The Director\|The Director]] believed her, and offered her a position at [[Astrayna/The lab\|The lab]]. Due to being able to graduate early, she accepted at the age of 17, which is the youngest anyone has entered the research side at [[Astrayna/The lab\|The lab]].
