# Power the machine
## What is it and how is it done
Those with magic can channel their energy through it in order to give power/energy to it. However, this is very strenuous and requires a lot of skill, and even then most people can't do it for very long. Most of the people who are able to preform this are from the [[Astrayna/Landry\|Landry]] clan, since they tend to be better at their magic than others.
## How it's used in the story
During Act 1, Arledge uses this in order to power the [[Astrayna/rundown lab\|rundown lab]] and get information from it. He's able to access the files and records stored in the computers. Caelus also attempts it in order to put less load on Arledge, and is able to, but for much shorter amounts of time than Arledge is.
