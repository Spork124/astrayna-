# Planet history
A very young planet, only being 300 years old. It was created of the person [[Astrayna\|Astrayna]], who was The Director's old friend. The planet visual resembles her, and the environment is based off her personality. It's hosted lots of plant life, animal life, and even the start of a [[Astrayna/civilization\|civilization]]. 
# Planet environment
The planet has seasons, but they're not very extreme. All of them border on the warmer side, with there only being 2 very distinct seasons. While this allows for the plant and wildlife to flourish all year round, the lack of change in animals and plants can wear on the nutrients of the planet. With the sun being red, most of the plant life is too. The animals have thus adapted to blend in to the red environment, and see anything that stand out.  
# Plot importance
The plant that [[Astrayna/Caelus\|Caelus]] and [[Astrayna/Arledge\|Arledge]] get stranded on in the beginning of the story. It is also something [[Astrayna/The Director\|The Director]] is attempting to get back to, and his motivation for creating [[Astrayna/The lab\|The lab]]. The planet also houses the embryo's of the [[Astrayna/Ortiz\|Ortiz]] clan, along with a now [[Astrayna/rundown lab\|rundown lab]] they made to ensure the safety of their embryo's.
