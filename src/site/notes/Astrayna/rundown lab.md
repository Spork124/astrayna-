# Rundown Lab
## Introduced as
Caelus and Arledge first find it when they're talking to the [[Astrayna/civilization\|civilization]] on [[Astrayna/Astrayna (planet)\|Astrayna (planet)]]. The [[Astrayna/civilization\|civilization]] seems to worship this building, and they're not sure why
## Plot importance
The rundown lab is where the [[Astrayna/Ortiz\|Ortiz]] clan stored their embryo's when they were being purged by the [[Astrayna/Landry\|Landry]] clan. The [[Astrayna/Ortiz\|Ortiz]] clan, after helping the [[Astrayna/civilization\|civilization]], told them that when they return it will be from that building, and thus the [[Astrayna/civilization\|civilization]] started protecting and worshipping it.
